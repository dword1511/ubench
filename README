Platform Specified Information
======================================================
Linux:

This program requires kernel version 2.6.28 or later to run on Linux. Elder kernel may work, but may not work perfectly.
This program will not work with some special file systems, such as tmpfs.

iOS:
iOS support is not unlikely to be done at present due to the lack of the toolchain required.

Other platform untested at the moment.
