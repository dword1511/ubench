ubench
A simple storage device benchmark tool for POSIX systems that operates on the top of a file system.

Require kernel version 2.6.28 or later to run on Linux.
iOS support is not unlikely at present due to the short of the toolchain required.
Other platform untested.
This program will not work for some special file systems, such as tmpfs.

WARNING:
Running this program on nearly worn-out devices may render the device unstable or even damaged.
Never try this with NOR flash memories in routers, they are slow and they are fragile.
